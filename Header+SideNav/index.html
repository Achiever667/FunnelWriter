                Secrets
                to making money from the endless list of high
                paying opportunities available
                for whatever skill you have
                A free guide by Oluwashina Peter
                Imagine this
                - The year is 1995, the global economy is booming. Nigeria is a great nation
                generating huge revenue from agriculture and oil exports.
                Naira is nearly equivalent with the British pound sterling. The standard
                way of success is to study a reputable course in the university, get a good job
                (which was in excess abundance), marry the partner of your dream, raise
                beautiful kids and live a perfect life.
                Fast forward to 2020, Nigeria is in debt, the economy is bad with 85 million
                people living in multidimensional poverty. A once renowned world giant is now
                the poverty capital of the entire world.
                Millions of graduates are flooding the streets every year with no hope of finding
                a job, the available jobs are paying less than $150 (₦60,000).
                The rate of a dollar to Naira is as high as #480 which means the price of
                goods and services are going up at an alarming rate while the income is still
                the same but this is good news for those who earn in foreign currencies.
                The country’s educational system teaches the young minds knowledge from
                the 1800s, while the society and the nature of jobs have changed and such
                knowledge is no longer applicable.
                There are new professions that didn’t exist 10 years ago such as social
                media managers, app developers, influencers and many more.
                Where is the hope for the youth-dominated country?
                If you’re reading this, it shows you want to break out of the system and
                earn a good living for yourself.
                However if you’re the type who doesn’t like to put in effort and expects
                massive returns.
                I’ll suggest you stop right now and look for the next “easy thing” to make
                money.
                *waits for some minutes*
                Still here?
                Great. It means you’re ready to put in some work. Let’s go!
                What I’m going to share in this free guide is valuable information you
                might not get anywhere else for free.
                The industry I will be sharing its insider secrets with you is the
                Blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.
                The Blockchain industry is worth over $400 billion dollars, hundreds of
                thousands of jobs and opportunities have been created in this industry
                and these jobs pay exceedingly well, higher than normal.
                While majority of people are focusing on buying some unrealistic
                miracle cryptocurrency that will turn their #5000 to #1,000,000 in 10
                days.
                The smart ones are offering their skills and services to companies in this
                industry and are earning as much as $2000 per month from the comfort of
                their homes without needing any formal education!
                That is a lucky Nigerian’s annual salary in one month.
                There are tons of opportunities in this industry and I’m going to expose
                them to you.
                Stay with me, let's dive deeper.
                I HAVE AN AMAZING GIFT FOR YOU AT THE END OF THIS GUIDE. ..
                WHY SHOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME?
                I’ve made terrible mistakes. I’ve been scammed. I’ve learnt. I’ve taken my time to
                build my skills. I’ve made tons of money.
                I will make my first million dollars before age 30 (Speaking it into existence, don’t
                rob me)
                Here’s a short background of my journey.... Warning, you might cry!
                I was in my fourth year in university when a friend introduced me to something
                called Bitcoin.
                He fed me all sorts of lies just to make me join the popular Ponzi scheme, MMM, that
                accepts Bitcoin as a means of payment. I tried it and made some money, then the
                whole scheme crashed.
                Now, I was hooked on that fast money and enjoyed doing nothing but wait to make
                money. I went down the rabbit hole and searched for more things about making
                money with Bitcoin.
                WHY SHOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME?
                I had very little in-depth knowledge of what it truly was except it’s an
                investment that grows or so I thought.
                Fortunately, I received my late dad’s pension and I invested everything in Bitcoin. I
                was lucky to make a lot of money within a short period of time but that was where
                my problem began.
                I was high on the quick money but I had some entrepreneurial gusto, so a friend and I
                created a mini-hedge fund where we helped others trade and invest money in Bitcoin.
                Then the market came down and we lost a huge amount of money……….again.
                I guess humans never learn.
                I had to take a meagre #20,000 per month job, work like a donkey and have just
                #1000 left as savings at the end of the month.
                Well, I quit my job and started seeking experts in the blockchain space and offered to
                work for them for free so I can learn more.
                I discovered a secret the top guys didn’t tell anyone! They were working directly with
                cryptocurrency and Blockchain companies, earning tons of money!!
                I had to commit to learning, made lots of sacrifices (not in the Nollywood context
                anyways) and how would I forget the beautiful ladies I had to forsake.
                It was tough through setbacks and failures but I cracked the secrets, ever since I have
                worked in the marketing teams of multi-million dollar projects and made lots of money
                at it.
                I have educated thousands of people about Blockchain and cryptocurrency, so they can
                understand it goes way beyond buying some magic coin.
                I have taught hundreds of people on how to make money by offering their skills to
                companies in the blockchain & cryptocurrency industry to fulfil the
                Nigerian dream – earn in dollars, spend in Naira.
                I am one of the most sought after blockchain-related digital marketers and educators in
                Nigeria.
                Here's a picture of me speaking to
                University students in Lagos.
                WHY AM I TELLING YOU ALL OF THESE?
                I needed to shake you up and let you know what lies ahead. It’s not a Ponzi
                scheme, you have to put in some efforts.
                Trillions of dollars exchange hands everyday. If you’re still broke, it’s because
                you do not have the right information, knowledge or work ethic.
                The information you’re about to read can make you lots of money
                You can choose which skill to learn after reading this report.
                Your money can also make you money. I revealed some secrets about that
                below.
                What is Cryptocurrency?
                Cryptocurrency is a digital asset with monetary value that can be
                transferred from one person to another across borders at the speed of
                a text message over the internet.
                Unlike the Naira, Dollar or Euro they are not controlled and managed
                by a bank or government, instead, they are managed by people like
                you and I participating in a network called Blockchain.
                Back in 2007/2008, the global economy was hit by a financial crisis
                that shook the world which was caused by the monetary system the
                world was using (cash and credit).
                In 2009, an anonymous person or group of people (nobody knows the
                true identity) called Satoshi Nakamoto created a new payment system
                called Bitcoin, a digital currency that has a limited supply and can be
                sent from one person to another across the internet without the need
                of a third party like banks.
                WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN AND CRYPTOCURRENCY?
                Although, the internet has made the whole world a global village that can
                communicate at long distances in real-time, prior to the invention of Bitcoin, it was
                very difficult to transfer value across borders at a faster and cheaper rate.
                Today, you can send and receive money from your friend in distances as far as Siberia
                within seconds. All thanks to Bitcoin.
                Bitcoin has caught the attention of high-class individuals including the president of the
                United States!
                As at the moment of writing this, 1 Bitcoin is worth $11,000.
                I’ll give out some FREE BITCOIN at the end of this guide.
                Now focus, we’re just getting started.
                There are thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence today and some of the popular
                ones are – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Tether, Dash, Decred, Celo and many
                more.
                These cryptocurrencies are built with different functionalities, technicalities
                and they are all solving a problem.
                Inflation and currency devaluation is a problem most developing countries are
                facing, countries like Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Lebanon etc. are having difficult
                times of their lives as their currencies are practically useless.
                In Venezuela, you’ll need a bag full of money to buy a tissue paper. Political
                matters have made people who have all their life savings in the bank
                overnight beggars.
                Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not controlled by the government, so they
                offer a better store of value. Naira has lost over 70% of its value since 2015.
                Some projects like Celo are building amazing stuff like Stablecoins
                (cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of a dollar). You can easily buy them
                and keep your money in Stablecoins to avoid currency depreciation.
                The price of cryptocurrencies are determined by pure demand and supply.
                This opens up a market where cryptocurrencies can be traded with over $80
                billion traded every day.
                What is Blockchain?
                A Blockchain is a network, a database like your Google drive that stores data
                but it is controlled by thousands of computers (operated by people) scattered
                all around the world.
                We live in a world where we generate tons of data everyday – the picture of
                your family you took with your smartphone during Christmas, those thoughts
                you put on your Facebook page, the business proposal you saved on your
                computer, the content on your favorite blog you love to read every day,
                searching for random things on Google, all of those are data.
                Infact, every single thing you create with a computing device is Data. Have
                you ever wondered how these data are stored and how easy they can be
                accessed?
                They are stored on central servers! These servers are piles of computers in a
                warehouse somewhere that store information that are displayed to you when
                you request them e.g. Clicking on your Instagram profile, checking your bank
                account balance on your banking mobile app.
                Ever heard the phrase data is oil?
                There are over 3 billion people using the internet and they generate tons of
                data. If this data gets in the wrong hands, it could be catastrophic.
                Sometimes ago, Facebook, one of the largest data banks in the world, was in
                the news for user data violation. Yes, I’m talking about the Cambridge
                Analytical scandal. There were accusations of Russians syndicates using
                Facebook to manipulate the USA 2016 election in which Donald Trump was
                elected.
                That’s how powerful data is in the 21st century.
                Blockchain is an internet network that comprises voluntary participants that
                store data on their computers i.e. a shared database where everyone is part
                of, where everyone’s computer & smart phones in the world are acting as a
                database or server, this allows data to be transparent and much safer.
                Blockchain and cryptocurrency are two different things entirely. Blockchain is
                the land, cryptocurrencies are houses, schools and museums built on the land.
                Blockchain can be used for other innovations aside from cryptocurrency, there
                are lots of industries using this technology including Voting, Banking,
                Messaging Apps, Education & Academia, Cloud Storage, Fashion,
                Entertainment, Real estate, Insurance, Supply chain management, Accounting
                etc.
                HOW TO MAKE MONEY FROM THE BLOCKCHAIN AND
                CRYPTOCURRENCY INDUSTRY
                This industry is just 11 years old and quite experimental to an extent
                but billions of dollars is flowing through every single day.
                You might be thinking this industry looks like one for tech savvies and
                nerds, well not exactly, I’ll let you in on a secret real quickly.
                Writers in this industry make as much as 500$ per article. Yes, I mean
                $500 for a single article.
                TV presenters earn as much as $2000 monthly, Photographers earn
                as much as $3000 monthly,
                Digital marketers earn a whole lot more (I’m a living- proof) and
                programmers are ridiculously sought after.
                Cryptocurrency traders earn a lot of money too.
                Opportunities are in abundance and literally every skill is needed as this 11-year-old
                industry matures gradually.
                The truth is, skills are extremely scarce in the industry as not much people understand
                the technology behind it but you can.
                The good news is you don’t have to be smart or be a tech person to understand it.
                Hundreds of thousands of people are involved in this industry with different kinds of
                skills to make it blossom e.g. programmers, business managers, web developers, app
                developers, software developers, team leaders, business executives, investors, UI/UX
                Designers, lawyers.
                Digital marketers, photographers, YouTubers, entrepreneurs, social media managers,
                graphic designers, Tv presenters, copywriters, video editors, journalists, community
                managers, writers, customer service agents, secretaries, virtual personal assistants,
                translators, project ambassadors etc.
                I would need a 10-page book to list all the various skills actively working in
                the industry.
                One of my mentees, Chuks, landed a $400 per month remote job as a project
                ambassador. Guess what he does? He runs and educates people about a
                blockchain project in a Telegram group.
                There is a high chance you already run a group of some sort probably on
                WhatsApp, imagine getting paid for it.
                There are thousands of projects and businesses in the industry looking for
                your service and skill.
                The opportunities available are endless but I’ll explain a few of them
                CONTENT CREATION, CONTENT MARKETING, SOCIAL MEDIA
                MARKETING & COPYWRITING
                Every single business, company, project on earth is selling a product/service,
                including blockchain companies.
                They need to effectively communicate their ideas, services, products to their target
                audience through words, articles, blogs, videos, copy etc.
                People need to be aware of their existence or they might as well be out of
                business. These set of skills people are needed in extremely high demand to
                communicate and reach their target audience.
                I possess these skills and I can tell you I’m very well sought after, so much, I
                outsource most jobs to my mentees.
                Can you communicate complex ideas to a ten year old in simple English? Can you
                compel people to take action with words? Do you understand the algorithms of
                social media platforms?
                You can build a whole career with those skills in the blockchain industry and make
                ‘fuck-you’ money.
                AFFILIATE MARKETING
                Affiliate marketing is the process of earning a commission by promoting other
                people's (or company's) products.
                The industry is worth over $6.8 billion and growing exponentially.
                Affiliate marketing in the blockchain & cryptocurrency industry is simply helping
                blockchain businesses get more users, customers, etc.
                Here is one
                of my affiliate packages I run on the side
                I’m going to share and teach the procedure to 10 lucky people. I’ll share the details
                later.
                PROGRAMMING, SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT & WEB
                DEVELOPMENT/DESIGN
                I won’t lie, this industry is a tech-oriented industry but the holy grail of skills is this
                category.
                They are highly sought after. I don’t know jack shit about coding and stuff but these
                guys are pretty much paid well, I’m talking $120,000 per annum.
                If you’re a coder, I wanna shake your hand for making a good choice.
                I’ll add links to some job offers at the end of this guide.
                GRAPHIC DESIGNERS, UI/UX DESIGNERS
                As the use of the internet grows every day, the attention span is slowly
                declining. If you’re still reading, you’re one hell of a focused human being.
                Designers are highly needed to create beautiful designs, web pages that
                convey messages within seconds and hook the reader for as long as possible.
                They are ridiculously paid.
                CRYPTOCURRENCY TRADING
                Cryptocurrency is a volatile asset i.e. the price swings up and down frequently.
                This is because the market depends heavily on demand & supply, no regulation
                from any government.
                The frequent price swing is a huge opportunity for people who buy and sell.
                Although the concept of trading is simple – buy low and sell high, knowing when
                to buy and sell, having the emotional stability to go through is what
                differentiates $100,000 per month traders from $20 per month traders.
                There are two basic types of trading – Exchange trading and Peer to Peer
                trading.
                Exchange trading involves trading Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies against
                each other on high frequency exchanges like Binance, Huobi etc. It requires some
                level of knowledge to participate.
                Peer to Peer trading (P2P) is a simple buying and selling of Bitcoin or any
                cryptocurrency from your friends or network at a low price and sell to another
                person at a high price.
                For example, you could buy $500 worth of Bitcoin from a friend at 400 per $ to give
                a total of ₦200,000.
                You can then sell that same $500 Bitcoin to another person at 450 per $ to give a
                total of ₦225,000. You just made ₦25,000 on a single transaction.
                Imagine having at least 10 of these transactions per month.
                Insider secret revealed!!
                I paid $100 to get this information I’m about to give you for free. So listen carefully.
                Like I mentioned earlier, you make money on the naira difference in P2P
                trading.
                At the moment of writing this, in the crypto market $1 is around ₦465. There’s a
                place you can buy for ₦400 - ₦450.
                Download Crypto.com from Playstore or App store, register and submit the
                required ID for verification.
                Crypto.com is a company in Gibraltar that allows all sorts of crypto transactions.
                Once you have completed verification, you are allowed to buy Bitcoin or any
                cryptocurrency on the platform at the bank’s dollar rate.
                If you have a GTB, First Bank card. You are only allowed to buy $500 weekly at
                about ₦400-410 per $.
                If you have an Access Bank card, you are allowed to buy $7500 weekly at about
                ₦430-450 per $.
                You’re going to need three accounts. Create accounts on Bundle Africa, Binance and
                crypto.com
                Here’s the process. You’re going to buy USDT on crypto.com with your card, you will
                send the USDT (A stablecoin) to binance and convert it to BUSD, then withdraw the
                BUSD to your Bundle Africa wallet.
                Then sell BUSD for naira at ₦455-470 and withdraw to your bank account.
                You’ll have made over ₦15 on the price difference. If you run the procedure
                with $1000, you’re going to make over ₦9000 per cycle. Let’s assume you run
                this 30 times a month.
                You’ll make ₦270,000/$574. Over 55% of your capital. Not so bad, right?
                P.S. Do not run this procedure if the current market rate is lesser than the rate
                you’re buying from crypto.com. (Check the rate on Bundle to confirm)
                P.P.S I’ll not advise you to run this procedure with capital less than $300.
                P.P.P.S. Make sure you run a test run with about $20 to understand the
                process before you dive in deep.
                DIGITAL
                MARKETING, ADVERTISING, VIDEO MARKETING & INFLUENCER
                MARKETING
                Marketing! Marketing! I just fucking love this profession.
                There are thousands of blockchain projects and businesses that need more
                exposure and are willing to pay big bucks to people who can help get more eyes
                on them and retain those eyes.
                WRITING
                & JOURNALISM
                Do you have writing skills with a decent knowledge of blockchain,
                cryptocurrency and current with trends?
                You can make money writing for blogs and media houses.
                I’m a paid writer for Decentralize Africa and BlocknewsAfrica. You can read
                some of my articles, I promise, you will not be bored.
                This category probably has the lowest entry barrier, media houses are
                constantly on the lookout for new writers & journalists.
                Shoot them a mail. I’ll drop links at the end of the guide.

                THE 5-STEP STRATEGY TO LANDING HIGH PAYING GIGS IN THE
                BLOCKCHAIN/CRYPTOCURRENCY INDUSTRY……OR ANY OTHER
                INDUSTRY
                There are tons of skilled people out there who might never make it big. Do you wanna
                know why? They are not good at selling themselves! That’s why people with half their
                skills are crushing it.
                The most known will always beat the best. I’m probably not as smart as some people
                but I’ll always crush them because I know how to sell my services better.
                Now, let me take you through a brief sales class
                Jesus Christ the messiah had to sell the vision to his 12 disciples before they could follow
                him.
                One of the painful lessons I had to learn was that even though the industry was in dire
                need of skills, they had to know someone like me exists before they gave me gigs/jobs.
                They had to be aware I possess the skills they needed so I developed and mastered
                these 5 step strategies.
                I’ve been using this strategy over the past 5 years and the best part is that it works
                even in other industries.
                The 5-step strategy
                First step: Be in the same environment or platforms where blockchain
                companies are e.g. social media, news publication, conferences etc. You have
                to identify where representatives and key personnel of the industry spend
                more time and strategically position yourself there.
                A popular quote I heard one time ago says don’t marry for money but go to
                where rich people are and marry for love.
                Second step: Engage them and show them what you’re capable of.
                Communicate and tell them what you do. Let them know someone of your
                caliber exists.
                Third step: Identify the problems they need solutions to (which your skill
                solves), offer a brief free helping hand to help them solve that problem. Get
                them high on your cocaine supply. No one refuses free service.
                Fourth step: Wow them! Deliver high quality service during the brief helping
                period. This will show your proficiency. Let them think of you every time they need
                help in that area.
                Fifth step: Keep building your reputation, credibility and social capital. Keep
                communicating. Share your past accomplishments. Don’t be shy. Sell yourself. Now
                sit back and watch high ticket offers flow in. Negotiate like they won’t survive if
                they say no.
                This strategy has landed me in the marketing teams of million dollar projects
                numerous times.
                However, applying directly and referrals are great ways of landing gigs but
                applying the 5-step strategy alongside increases your chances by 400%.
                Leverage on the 5-step strategy and you will never have to look for a gig/job in the
                blockchain/cryptocurrency industry or any other.
                THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THIS INDUSRY:
                Nobody needs your certificate, what they want are your skills. What can you do to
                bring value to the table? Are you currently a university student? Are you a dropout?
                Are you working in an organization?
                Nobody cares, what can you do with your skills? What value can you offer? What can
                you do to help a multi-million dollar company
                Competition is less and the rewards are juicy!
                It’s only smart to be in this industry before eye enter am like fine mammy water girl.
                I once applied for a remote position with a venture-backed American blockchain
                company that raised $30 million in capital. I didn’t get the job but they created a new
                position for me. What did I do? During the four interview stages, I shamelessly sold
                myself. I listed out all my past accomplishments, skills and value I’m bringing to the
                table.
                The striking blow was I pointed out the problems I figured they had and what they
                needed to do to fix (The third step in the 5 step strategy…works like magic but don’t
                use it on me, please)
                The industry is a virgin and fertile land, plant your seeds early.
                If you’ll like to learn more about Blockchain & Cryptocurrency, the industry, how to
                earn and land high paying gigs without the need for a degree or certificate of some

                THE END
                The Digital economy is the only safe haven for most Nigerian youths.
                There are no jobs in the country, things are getting worser and more graduates are
                filling up the streets.
                The Blockchain industry offers lots of opportunities to be explored IF YOU ARE
                WILLING TO PUT IN AT LEAST A LITTLE AMOUNT OF WORK.
                I can say it so confidently because it has worked for me one too many time.
                I'm not a genius.....I just make MOVES!
